## Investigating Environemntal Suitability and its Impact on Global Top Crops

Building upon prior ecology research and environmental suitability modeling, (1) we train suitability models for asian rice (oryza sativa), sugar (saccharum officinarum), maize (zea mays), wheat (triticum aestivum), and arabica coffee (coffea arabica), (2) create a new method for calculating each countryâ€™s composite environmental suitability, (3) analyze feature importance of bioclimatic variables, and (4) conduct regional crop case studies

Setup:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate coffee_venv
```
